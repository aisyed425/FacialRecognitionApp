### Day 1
This is a little bit late I started the project a few days ago but I wanted to have a day 1 for some reason. Anyways, today I started with Jupyter Notebook and watched a few tutorials

### Day 2 
I switched to Google Colab and started with some rough code

### Day 3
Issues: The code works seemingly fine but it finds things besides just faces and interprets them as faces. I plan to use this to make a facial recognition lock for my cat. I probably have to change the haarcascade file to one that reads cat images. I'm not sure if my cat will be smart enough to use it he is a little bit dumb 😭
